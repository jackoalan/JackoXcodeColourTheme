Jacko's Xcode Colour Theme
==========================

My personal syntax-colouring theme for using Xcode.

Currently untitled, this theme provides a light-on-dark experience for using Xcode with a stateful insight. 

Literals are saturated with striking hues: Red for strings, yellow for numbers. External types are a grassy green, internal types a baby blue. External method calls gain a blue tint, while internal calls are given an empowering gold. Comments are given an off-yellow sepia tone, for a literary effect. 

Everything is made to contrast off a royal blue background. 

Download the [Installer Package](/downloads/jackoalan/JackoXcodeColourTheme/JackoXcodeColourThemeSigned.pkg) for easy installation.

How to install
--------------

Simply use the [installer PKG](/downloads/jackoalan/JackoXcodeColourTheme/JackoXcodeColourThemeSigned.pkg) attached to this repository to install the files automatically.

Alternatively, place the `.dvtcolorscheme` files in `~/Library/Developer/Xcode/UserData/FontAndColorThemes/`

Afterwards, quit and relaunch Xcode and Open `Xcode > Preferences`, switch to `Fonts & Colors`, then select the theme of choice.
